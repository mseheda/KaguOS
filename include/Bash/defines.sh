# This file contains a list of constants for KaguOS.
# It includes memory addresses that are used by the kernel.

# NOTE: We are using *_INFO_ADDRESS variables to store debug information in RAM
# so you can open tmp/RAM.txt and quickly understand what is the data was stored at some line.
# For example, we have GLOBAL_INPUT_ADDRESS and it is used to store real data from keyboard after corresponding call.
# We will print helper message "Keyboard buffer:" to the previous memory address GLOBAL_INPUT_INFO_ADDRESS.
# As a result, you can see the data stored at GLOBAL_INPUT_ADDRESS and its description in tmp/RAM.txt, for example:
#   line3: Keyboard buffer:
#   line4: <some text you have entered recently>

# RAM constants:
export GLOBAL_RAM_FILE="${GLOBAL_HW_DIR}/RAM.txt"

export GLOBAL_TERMINATE_ADDRESS="${GLOBAL_RAM_SIZE}"

# Kernel constants:
export GLOBAL_BUILD_DIR="build"

export GLOBAL_ENV_FILE="${GLOBAL_BUILD_DIR}/env.sh"
export GLOBAL_KERNEL_START_INFO_ADDRESS="19"

# You should write data to GLOBAL_DISPLAY_ADDRESS
# and call one of display_* functions to trigger real display of the data
export GLOBAL_DISPLAY_INFO="Display buffer:"

# Memory to store data read from keyboard.
# You should call read_input function wait for input
# and then you can use GLOBAL_INPUT_ADDRESS for further processing.

# You can use those two addreses as a temporary storage for some calls.

# Memory to store result of comparison done with cpu_execute
# For example, if you want to compare previous ouput with some string "test", you can use cpu_execute
#     write_to_address ${GLOBAL_ARG1_ADDRESS} "test"
#     cpu_execute "${CPU_EQUAL_CMD}" ${GLOBAL_ARG1_ADDRESS} ${GLOBAL_OUTPUT_ADDRESS}
# as a result GLOBAL_COMPARE_RES_ADDRESS will contain 1 or 0 based on comparison result.
# You can use this result later by backing it up to some othe memory address
# or you can perform conditional jump instruction aka jump_if
